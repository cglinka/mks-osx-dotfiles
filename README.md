dotfiles
========

This is the base set of config files, or "dotfiles", used on MakerSquare lab machines. This repo is formatted to work correctly with the [homesick gem](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

## I want!

To install these dotfiles on your own machine, just run the following at the console:

```console
gem install homesick
homesick clone https://github.com/makersquare/dotfiles.git
homesick symlink dotfiles
```
